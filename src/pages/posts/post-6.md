Viktor Frankl's powerful memoir and psychological theory emerged from his experiences in Nazi concentration camps. His key insights include:

1. The primary drive in life is the search for meaning
2. Meaning can be found even in suffering
3. We cannot control what happens to us, but we can control our response
4. Purpose gives us the strength to endure any challenge
5. Love is the ultimate source of meaning

His logotherapy approach teaches us that life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.
