# The Four Agreements: A Path to Personal Freedom

Don Miguel Ruiz presents four powerful agreements that can transform our lives when practiced consistently:

1. Be Impeccable with Your Word
2. Don't Take Anything Personally
3. Don't Make Assumptions
4. Always Do Your Best

These simple but profound agreements are based on ancient Toltec wisdom and can lead to personal freedom, true happiness, and self-mastery when integrated into daily life.
