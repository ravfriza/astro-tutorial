Yuval Noah Harari's "Sapiens" presents a fascinating journey through human history, revealing how Homo sapiens came to dominate the Earth. Here are the key revolutions that shaped our species:

1. The Cognitive Revolution (70,000 BCE)
2. The Agricultural Revolution (12,000 BCE)
3. The Scientific Revolution (1500 CE)

Harari argues that our ability to create and believe in shared myths - from religions to money to nations - has enabled unprecedented human cooperation and progress. This unique capacity for creating imagined realities sets us apart from all other species.
