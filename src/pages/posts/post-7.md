The Zen approach to happiness teaches us that true joy comes not from external circumstances, but from our inner state of being. Key principles include:

1. Everything that happens is the best possible thing that can happen
2. Happiness is a choice we make in each moment
3. Acceptance of what is leads to peace
4. The present moment is perfect as it is
5. Letting go of attachments brings freedom

By embracing these Zen principles, we can find contentment regardless of external circumstances.
