Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher king of Rome, left us with invaluable wisdom in his personal diary, now known as "Meditations." Here are some key principles of Stoicism from his writings:

1. Control what you can, accept what you cannot
2. Your perception shapes your reality
3. Focus on the present moment
4. Practice gratitude daily
5. Remember your mortality

These teachings remain remarkably relevant in our modern world, offering practical guidance for dealing with life's challenges.
